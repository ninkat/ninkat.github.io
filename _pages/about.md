I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Manitoba. I worked at the my insitution's [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hci.cs.umanitoba.ca/) in the summer of 2024, supervised by [Dr. David Gerhard](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gerhardd/) exploring throwing gestures in virtual reality. I will be working with [Waterloo HCI](https://uwaterloo.ca/human-computer-interaction/) in the Winter 2025 term, supervised by [Dr. Matthew Brehmer](https://mattbrehmer.ca/). My research interests include human-computer interaction, virtual and augmented reality, and spatial computing.
