I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Manitoba and a research assistant at the [University of Waterloo HCI Lab](http://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/), advised by [Dr. Matthew Brehmer](https://mattbrehmer.ca/). Previously, I worked at the University of Manitoba's [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://hci.cs.umanitoba.ca/) advised by [Dr. David Gerhard](https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gerhardd/). My research interests include human-computer interaction, virtual and augmented reality, and information visualization.
